"""
Motion pipeline for trajectory generation and execution.

This module provides a unified pipeline for all motion commands:
- Cartesian commands (MoveCart, MoveCartRelTrf)
- Joint commands (MovePose, MoveJoint)
- Smooth shapes (Circle, Arc, Helix, Spline)

All commands produce a JointPath that gets converted to a Trajectory
via time-optimal path parameterization (TOPP-RA).

Streaming executors provide real-time jerk-limited motion for jogging.

Geometry generators provide path geometry for visualization and preview.
